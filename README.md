# CMS Icons and artwork

SVG icons and font for the Advanced CMS project (Bluefoot).

Preview (admin): https://magento-ux.github.io/cms-icons/scss/pagebuilder-icons.html
Preview (storefront): https://magento-ux.github.io/cms-icons/scss/CMS-Storefront-Icons.html

Uses https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont to build the icon font and the CSS classes from the folder of SVG images.

## Working with the project

Run 'yarn' in the root of the project and then run 'grunt' to build the icons.

Any improvements or suggestions are welcome ;-)
